The work in this module involved acquiring, examining, and cleaning data with the goal of joining two files; one that had spatial geometry (i.e. shapes of U.S. counties) and a second file that containted only adata field, but no spatial geometry. The join was possible by "linking" two fields that shared a common data number, in this case, the identifier for all U.S. counties which was geoid and fips fields. Other tasks in this module involved exploring different symbology criteria (color, classification, graduated choropleth symbology), creating a news field for the number of people per square mile.

The field calculator was used to create a new data column that contained the population of people per square mile. This involved calculating a new field from the "ALAND" field that contained square meters for each U.S. county by 0.0000003861003 to get a new field "area_sqmi". A second calcuation involved dividing the number of people in each census tract by the number of square miles in each specific census tract which resulted in the number of persons per square mile. The next step involved creating a map showing maps of the continental U.S. and also individual maps for Alaska and Hawaii as well as a seperate GeoJSON file for the state of Michigan. The final step involved serving the map of the U.S. to a web page for ease of sharing and distribution.
